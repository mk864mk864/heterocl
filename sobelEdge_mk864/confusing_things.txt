Confusing things while working on this project:

1. The whole structure of how to use hcl.
I think it would be helpful if there was a seciton in getting started that has a diagram or sample code of just

hcl.init()
placeholders
(hcl.asarray)
define kernel
create schedule
build schedule
run the built thing

and to specify that you have to put in an hcl structure for output into running the built thing.
The idea of putting in placeholders for create schedule and actually putting in the real data for running was confusing.

2. Datatype for placeholder, init, compute
I forgot to specify float for all, so it might be good to mention to be careful with type declaration

3. for loop range for Python
People without much Python experience might think for(0,3) includes 3... if people who will use HCL might not have
used Python much, maybe worth including?

4. Defining kernel
When you define the kernel, does the variable name need to be the same as the placeholders you will use later for creating schedule?
I think some examples on the website does that and I wasn't sure if it was necessary. If not necessary, it might be good to make them
different names on the website examples just to clarify that.
